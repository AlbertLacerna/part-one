			<td><h4 id="id3">A Fire alarm is important on how you can know where's fire from comming from and prevent it from spreading aroud you and even if you this fire alarm is important when your love ones are asleep since when a fire happens you can't feel it. What this could mean is you can suffocate without even feeling it and die. That's what fire's smoke can do you while your asleep.

			<td><h4 id="id3">Simple as this smokeing can cause fire when the bud is still active and when left in the forest or near curtains for the windows this is where fires can get started due to it being flamable in the first place. This is why you don't smoke in the forest nor near any areas you may think is flamable. Since once it starts the damage may be devastataing.</h4></td>

			<td><h4 id="id3">Even your love ones can cause fire and knowing that it may be exhausting to watch them 24/7 you must at least do your part to make sure that they don't start a fire or even burrning of their fingers by the matches. What you can do is to make sure to ask you other love ones to watch them though it may be a short visit to the grocery and make sure any flamable objects like matches or oil are kept away from the child's reach.</h4></td>

			<td><h4 id="id3">You should double check on your wiring on the devices you use since the proble here is that if the wire is expose. It could cause a spark or start a fire. But there's more look if the output and input matches or the needed amount of electricity on your appliances. Since your appliances could imploade if overvoltage. Also make your using right an example of this is your christmas lights and though it may be nice double check the ones that you got cheap from divisoria since and may no be safe outside use or it may be faulty and was not approve by an organazation that checks it if it's safe to use. </h4></td></h5></td></tr>
